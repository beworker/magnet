Magnet is a minimalist dependency injection and [dependency inversion][1] library for Android helping to write modular applications. If you need a simple, fast and non-intrusive dependency injection library, then Magnet is a good choice for you. It can also be interesting for growing Kotlin community because of its Kotlin-friendly API.

Magnet does **not** use reflection for object creation. It is based on annotation processor which prepares and partly validates dependency graph of your application at build-time. Final creation and validation of the dependency graph happens at runtime. This deliberate design decision esures a fair balance between fully statical and fully dynamic dependency injection. Properly designed Magnet-application allows adding and removing application functionality by adding and removing modules in application's build script whithout any additional programming effort. In that respect Magnet enforces modular design and helps modules be developed and tested in isolation.

Magnet is well documented and covered by unit tests.

# Design
Magnet has a very minimalist, almost naive, design. It deals with just two concepts - `Scopes` and `Instances`. The whole design can be described by four simple statements:

1. `Scopes` are containers for object `Instances`.
2. `Scopes` can build up hierarchies.
3. `Instances` can be put into (bound) and taken from `Scopes`.
4. `Instances` can depend on other instances.
